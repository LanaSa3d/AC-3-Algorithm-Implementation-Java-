# AC-3-Algorithm-Implementation-Java-
This repository contains a Java implementation of the AC-3 (Arc Consistency) algorithm, a fundamental algorithm used to solve Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs).


📌 Overview

The AC-3 algorithm enforces arc consistency by iteratively reducing variable domains and eliminating values that violate constraints. It is widely used in artificial intelligence, search problems, and constraint-based systems.
